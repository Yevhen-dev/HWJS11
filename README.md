Tasks: 

1) onContextMenu

    Create a text block element, on which, when you right-click the mouse, instead of the usual context menu of the browser, your own created context menu appears. This menu may contain options such as "align center", "align center right", "align left", "Hide element".

2) keyup

    Create a game field where the user can move an object (such as a square or a circle) using the arrow keys. The movement of the object should stop when the key is released

3) Create a P element that changes the text to "Hello, World!" when the mouse is hovered over, and reverts to the original text when the mouse is moved away.

4) Create two div elements. One of them should appear when the mouse is hovered over the other, and disappear when the mouse is moved away from it.

5) Additional Task

    'onMouseDown' and 'onMouseUp': Implement a simple 'Drag and drop' game: create an object that can be dragged within a certain area using the mouse button click and release events.

Practices in DOM actions.
No issue during the working on code.
